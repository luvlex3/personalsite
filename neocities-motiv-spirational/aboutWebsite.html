 <h1> The Story Behind My Website</h1>

    CLICK <a href ="index.html">HERE</a> to return to homepage.
    <p> In thinking of a project to do I was really struggling.  I didn't know what to create, a game, or maybe a simulation of something, but as I got to thinking I decided on a website.  I was going through a rough patch with school and stressing about everything, when I thought to myself why not make a website to help people. I love serving others and trying to make others feel a part of somthing and helping people be happy.  I see too many peolpe in a day that look so unhappy and stressed, so here is my website.  A website to help those very people who are looking for help and searching for something more to help them be more happy and motivated.  Through this website I am going to post many  fun and interesting posts that will hopefully motivate, inspire, and overall help people become more happy with themselves and others.  I hope you enjoy!  </p>
